                    <li>The first response will be taken into consideration if there are two (2) replies written on the board, each surrounded by a circle or rectangle.</li>
                    <li>In order to prevent any changes being made to the Final Answer, watchers will be allocated to each quizzer's column.</li>
                    <li>Upon the expiration of the allotted time, the quiz master will call on the participants to elevate their boards and declare the ultimate solution. As the Panel of Judges and the Quiz Master record the points, quiz takers who correctly answered will continue to stand with their boards raised. Note: The Panel of Judges retains the authority to amend Item </li>
                    <li>The final answer will be deemed incorrect if spelling is incorrect. 9. Quizzers who provide an erroneous or blank response will not lose points.</li>
                    <li>Quizzers who provide incorrect or no answers will not lose any points.</li>
                    <li>It is completely forbidden to use reference books, e-books, notebooks, cell phones, or any other materials or devices that may contain information while the competition is being held. If the aforementioned regulation is broken, the participant will be deemed forfeited.</li>
